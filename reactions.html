        <p class="stuffHeader">Neutralization Reactions</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">Of those reactions that involve acids and bases, the most important is the neutralization reaction. As one might well guess from the word “neutral” in the name, the neutralization reaction balances the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions in a solution, thus making it neutral. While there is only one way to neutralize a base, there are in fact three methods through which one can neutralize an acid.</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Acid-Base Neutralization</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">One way to neutralize an acid is to react it with a base. According to the Arrhenius Theory, acids dissociate in water to produce an imbalance of hydrogen ions, and bases dissociate in water to produce an imbalance of hydroxide ions. Combined in the correct proportions, an acid and a base would produce the same concentration of hydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(Leon)</a> These hydrogen and hydroxide ions would react to form water, and thus the solution would be neutral. Resultantly, an acid-base neutralization is always of the form acid + base → salt + water. Note that the salts produced must be neutral; as they can neither produce hydrogen ions nor hydroxide ions (both have already been produced through neutralization). One common example of acid base neutralization is the reaction between hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). In the reaction, hydrochloric acid gives away a hydrogen ion and sodium hydroxide accepts it, making hydrochloric acid the acid (gasp!) and sodium hydroxide the base. The reaction yields dihydrogen monoxide, or water, and sodium chloride, which is table salt!</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Acid-Metal Neutralization</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">Another way to neutralize an acid is to react it with a metal. As the acid reacts with the metal, it will produce salt, the type of which depends on the particular acid. HCl, or hydrochloric acid, produces salts of the chloride family. HNO<sub>3</sub>, or nitric acid, produces salts of the nitrate family. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or sulphuric acid, produces salts of the sulphate family. The hydrogen ions produced by the dissociation of the acid will be unable to bond with hydroxide ions (as there are none) and will be forced to bond with one another, creating H<sub>2</sub> or hydrogen gas. Thus, acid-metal neutralizations are always of the form acid + metal → salt + H<sub>2</sub> (gas). When sulphuric acid reacts with magnesium for example, the former gives away its hydrogen and takes magnesium in its place: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Mg → H<sub>2</sub> (gas) + MgSO<sub>4</sub>. The result is the salt magnesium sulphate and hydrogen gas, just as in theory.</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Acid-Carbonate Neutralization</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">The third method of acid neutralization is the acid-carbonate reaction. (Note that carbonates are substances of the form XCO<sub>3</sub>, where X is an ion) When an acid reacts with a carbonate, the hydrogen ions of the former react with oxygen in the latter to form dihydrogen monoxide, or water. The remaining CO<sub>2</sub> in the carbonate becomes carbon dioxide gas. Lastly, the remainder of the acid reacts with the leading ion of the carbonate to form a salt, the type of which depends on the acid family (see acid-metal neutralization above). As a result, acid-carbonate reactions are always of the form acid + carbonate → salt + water + CO<sub>2</sub> (gas). One can take, for example the reaction between nitric acid and sodium chlorate (NaCO<sub>3</sub>). The acid donates hydrogen ions, which releases carbon dioxide, and thus the yield is H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Note that both water and the salt, calcium nitrate, are neutral.</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Titrations</p>
        <a href="http://www.shsu.edu/~chm_tgc/sounds/pushmovies/titrate.gif"><img class="leftImage" src="http://www.shsu.edu/~chm_tgc/sounds/pushmovies/titrate.gif"/></a><p class="stuffParagraph">As mentioned in the above section on acid-base neutralization, to neutralize an acid and a base, one must react the two together in certain proportions. These proportions depend on the properties of the two solutions. It is possible, however, to ascertain said proportions without knowledge of the acid and the base through a process called titration. In a titration, first the base in question is measured, and then three drops of an indicator such as phenolphthalein are added. Phenolphthalein turns a basic solution pink-colored, and can act as a pH indicator. Once the base-phenolphthalein solution is prepared, acid is carefully added incrementally in small amounts (being careful to agitate the solution) until the pink-color disappears. Once the color disappears, the solution is neutral. Depending on the increment in which the acid is added, titrations can be quite precise. The animation provides an example of a titration, but note the slightly different procedure. (Note: This gif does not repeat. To restart gif, refresh the page) To perform a titration, the following materials are required: one sterile burette, one sterile funnel, one clamp stand, one sterile volumetric pipet, one pipet pump, one small sterile pipet, one sterile 100 cc beakers, one sterile 100 cc conical flask, a beaker of acid, a beaker of base, and 20 cc phenolphthalein. The procedure is as follows:<br>1. Clamped burette to clamp stand.<br>2. Closed burette and placed empty beaker beneath.<br>3. Used funnel to fill burette halfway with acid. Recorded volume of acid.<br>4. Attached pipet pump to volumetric pipet.<br>5. Filled flask with 10cc of base using volumetric pipet, and added 3 drops phenolphthalein using pipet. Agitated well. (The solution should be pink in color)<br>6. Place flask under burette.<br>7. Using burette, added acid to the basic mixture drop by drop, and agitated basic mixture continuously.<br>8. Ceased to add acid to mixture once mixture had lot pink color. Recorded volume of acid.<br>9. Calculated and recorded acid usage.<br>10. Cleaned and/or replaced/replenished materials and repeated for further trial data.</p>
