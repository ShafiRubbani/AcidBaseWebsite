        <p class="stuffParagraph">Acids and bases have been defined in multiple ways in the past two centuries. The three major theories recognized today are all considered correct definitions, but provide varying perspective and depth into the behaviors of such substances.</p>

        <a href="http://cdn1.askiitians.com/Images/2014811-104639241-8127-acidsbases.gif"><img style="width:260px;height:auto" class="rightImage" src="http://cdn1.askiitians.com/Images/2014811-104639241-8127-acidsbases.gif"/></a><p class="stuffParagraph">A Swedish scientist named Svante Arrhenius defined the first of the major theories, the Arrhenius Theory, in 1887. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(Encyclopaedia Britannica)</a> Arrhenius characterized substances as acidic or basic based on their interactions with water. He said that a substance that dissociates in water to produced hydrogen ions (H+ ions) was acidic, and that a substance that dissociates in water to produce hydroxide ions (OH- ions) was basic. For example, HNO<sub>3</sub>, or nitric acid, dissociates in water to form hydrogen and nitrate ions: HNO<sub>3</sub> → H<sup>+</sup> + NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. This qualifies it as an Arrhenius acid. Lithium hydroxide, or LiOH, dissociates to produce lithium and hydroxide ions: LiOH → Li<sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>-</sup>. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(University of California Davis)</a> This qualifies it as an Arrhenius base. It is of note that hydrogen ions exist in water only as hydronium ions (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions), a slight error in Arrhenius’ original theory. Using the Arrhenius Theory, it is possible to quantify the potency of an acid or base based on the extent to which it associates, and thus characterize it as strong or weak. This method will be discussed in the next section.</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Brønsted-Lowry Theory</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and English scientist Thomas Martin Lowry separately created the Proton Theory of Acids and Bases. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(Encyclopaedia Britannica)</a> This theory defined acids and bases more generally than Arrhenius’, saying that an acid was any substance that could act as a proton (H<sup>+</sup> ion) donor, and that a base was any substance that could act as a proton receiver. For example, the reaction between ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) is of the form: HCl + NH<sub>3</sub> → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup>. Because hydrochloric acid donates a hydrogen ion to ammonia, the former is a Brønsted-Lowry acid and the latter is a Brønsted-Lowry base. Note that according to this theory, the substance that received the hydrogen ion (in this case NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is known as the conjugate acid, and the substance that lost the hydrogen ion, (in this case Cl<sup>-</sup>) is known as the conjugate base. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(Bodner Research Web)</a> The Brønsted-Lowry Theory had two important distinctions from the Arrhenius Theory. Firstly, it allows for atoms and molecules alike to be acids and bases. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, it characterizes substances based on the way they act in reactions. This allows a substance like water (H<sub>2</sub>O) to act as both an acid and a base, as it can be either a hydrogen ion donor or a hydrogen ion receiver.<br>The Brønsted-Lowry Theory classifies acids according to the number of acidic hydrogens they possess. Acidic hydrogens are those hydrogen atoms in a molecule that can be donated. These disposable hydrogens will (generally) be those on the left-hand side. For example vinegar, or acetic acid, has a chemical formula of HCH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>. While this molecule contains four hydrogen atoms, it can only donate the one on the left. Acetic acid is a monoprotic acid, as it can only donate one hydrogen ion. Acids like sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) that have two acidic hydrogens are referred to as diprotic, and acids that have three are referred to as triprotic.</p>

        <p class="stuffHeader">Lewis Theory</p>
        <p class="stuffParagraph">The Lewis Theory, created by American chemist Gilbert N. Lewis, was also published in 1923. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(Encyclopaedia Britannica)</a> According to Lewis, acids are those substances that can bond with unshared electron pairs, and bases are those substances that can share them. The two form a covalent bond. For example, when boron trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>) and N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> react, they bond covalently. <a href=”bibliography.html”>(salisbury.edu)</a> The former shares the electron pair of the latter, thus the former is a Lewis acid and the latter a Lewis base. Lewis’ definitions are much broader than those above, often beyond the scope of the term usage, and for this reason Lewis acids and Lewis bases are referred to explicitly as such.</p>
